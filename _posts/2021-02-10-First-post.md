This is my first post in hopefully a series of blogs on various matters of programming. 

First of all a bit about this blog. I'm trying out GitHub Pages via [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) template. I'm no front end developer (yet!) so this is all quite new to me. The process of getting the blog up seems simple (clone the template and change the defaults) although the examples look a lot nicer that what I have so far! At some point I'm hoping to try out different layouts but for now I'm going with "perfect is the enemy of good" and trying to start with some content.

My main background is in .NET so I'm hoping to start with some deep dives in to some areas of high performance .NET, building some OSS libraries as I go, but we'll see how much time I get to spend on this!
